#### Important notes ####
- Please be advised that this software is not tested by a professional QA team or expert so it may contain bugs and it might 
be unstable at some points, but as I did some deep tests during development, the APK shared here should be stable enough not to
crash, although it may do due to some reason. If this happens please send me a report and a screenshot where it crashed on my email address as specified above.
- This application is still under development so it will have frequent changes in the code and the APK version will be updated respectively.
- Offline cases are still not completed, so the app is most likely not going to work offline
